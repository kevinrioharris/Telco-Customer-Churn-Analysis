## **Project Overview**

### **Problem Statement**
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecommunication companies, leading to significant revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs. Predicting and understanding customer churn enables businesses to implement targeted retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

### **Solution**
This project focuses on:
1. **Analyzing customer data** to uncover key drivers of churn.
2. **Building predictive models** to accurately identify at-risk customers.
3. **Developing an interactive Streamlit application** to enable users to explore insights, evaluate model performance, and make predictions.

## **Prediction Modes in Streamlit Application**

The **Model Prediction** page in this project offers three distinct modes for predicting customer churn, catering to different user requirements. Below is a detailed explanation of each mode:

### **1. Single Prediction**
This mode allows users to predict churn for an individual customer by manually inputting their details.

- **Steps:**
  1. Use the **sidebar** to input customer attributes like tenure, online security, monthly charges, etc.
  2. Click the **Predict** button to see the result.
- **Output:**
  - A clear and color-coded result:  
    - **ðŸš¨ "The customer will churn!"** (Red)  
    - **âœ… "The customer will NOT churn!"** (Green)  
  - Displays customer details for transparency.

This mode is ideal for analyzing churn risk for individual cases or hypothetical scenarios.

---

### **2. Batch Prediction (File Upload)**
This mode supports predicting churn for multiple customers at once by uploading a CSV file containing customer data.

- **Steps:**
  1. Prepare a CSV file with customer attributes. Ensure it includes the required columns:
     - `Dependents`, `tenure`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, `InternetService`,  
       `DeviceProtection`, `TechSupport`, `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `MonthlyCharges`.
  2. Upload the CSV file via the provided uploader.
  3. Click **Predict Batch** to generate predictions.
- **Output:**
  - A table displaying each customer's details along with the **Churn_Prediction** column.
  - Option to **download predictions** as a CSV file.

This mode is designed for processing large datasets efficiently.

---

### **3. Batch Prediction (Manual Input)**
This mode enables users to input data for multiple customers directly in the app.

- **Steps:**
  1. Specify the number of customers to input.
  2. Fill out the details for each customer in the form provided.
  3. Click **Predict Batch (Manual)** to generate predictions.
- **Output:**
  - A table displaying the manually entered data along with the **Churn_Prediction** column.

This mode is useful for testing small datasets or when data entry flexibility is needed.

---

### **Common Features Across Modes**
- **Interactive Data Entry:** User-friendly forms and inputs to capture data.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Leverages the trained model (`model.pkl`) for instant results.
- **Churn Indicators:** Displays whether a customer is likely to churn (`Yes`) or not (`No`).
- **Ease of Use:** No programming knowledge required to operate.

These prediction modes ensure flexibility and scalability, allowing users to address both individual and bulk prediction needs effectively.
